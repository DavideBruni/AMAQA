## Ethical consideration

The data collection was conducted with care to include only information from public Telegram channels and groups, explicitly excluding personal data such as usernames, phone numbers, user IDs, and chat IDs. The process aligns with Telegramâ€™s Terms of Service ([Telegram Terms of Service](https://telegram.org/tos/), accessed 2025-01-27) and Telegram APIâ€™s Terms of Service ([Telegram API Terms of Service](https://core.telegram.org/api/terms), accessed 2025-01-27), as neither prohibits the collection of public chat data. We have also taken care to avoid flooding the platform with excessive requests during data collection.

Furthermore, our research complies with the academic research exemptions outlined in Article 85 of the GDPR ([Article 85 GDPR](https://gdpr-text.com/read/article-85/), accessed 2025-01-27), which provide flexibility for processing publicly available data in the interest of freedom of expression and academic purposes. Since our work exclusively involves publicly accessible content and does not handle private user data, it qualifies for legitimate or public interest exemptions. 

Additionally, we follow the GDPRâ€™s principle of data minimization by focusing solely on English textual content from public posts, ensuring that only the information necessary for our research objectives is processed ([Data protection under GDPR](https://europa.eu/youreurope/business/dealing-with-customers/dataprotection/data-protection-gdpr/index_en.htm), accessed 2025-01-27). Finally, as the dataset includes channels and groups that discuss controversial topics, it may contain some controversial messages.
